  <p class=Question><span class="bold">How much power does Elon Musk have over the cryptocurrency market?</span></p>

  <p class=title1><span class="bold">The aims of my project</span></p>

  <p class=title3><span>It is without question that Elon Musk is one of the most powerful public figures in the world. He is known to be quite a controversial character, which mostly stems from his unfiltered use of social media and wild entrepreneurial ideas dissimilar to that of other influential high net worth individuals. In recent years, he has become infatuated with the growing world of cryptocurrencies. In February 2021, his company Tesla announced they had purchased $1.5bn of Bitcoin (the largest cryptocurrency).  He also regularly posts cryptocurrency related items on his twitter feed which attract lots of attention in the forms of likes and retweets and is most notably known for poking fun at one cryptocurrency, Dogecoin. This cryptocurrency was set up as a joke with no fundamental purpose in 2013 to make fun at the wild speculation around cryptocurrencies at the time. However, in recent years the coin has gathered serious media amassing a market cap of $22bn making it the 12th largest coin on the market and many attribute this to Elon Musk.
  Hence, in this project, I aim to investigate, through the means of chart and regression analysis, the impact that Elon Musk’s actions have on the cryptocurrency market.

<p class=title1><span class="bold">The data I used and how this was accessed</span></p>

<p class=title3><span>In Chart 1 used daily spot data from Binance which was available in csv files segregated by month. Hence, the data had to be merged for analysis to be carried out. The merging process will be described in detail in the next section. Charts 2, 4 and 6 used data from yahoo finance and this was accessed using python through installing the ‘yfinance’ module in google colab. Chart 2 used data from Nomics’ API, this proved difficult for two reasons. The first one being that they do not offer a free API so I had to pay the small sum of $1 for a key. Chart 5 on Tesla used Alpha Vantages’ API, however due to limitations in the customisability of the API, not allowing me to select a date range caused difficulties in making an interactive chart later. So I decided to download the data using python with the AlphaVantage package - click here to see the code. Charts 7 and 8 used CoinAPI.

<p class=title1><span class="bold">Challenges in data cleaning and/or analysis, and the tools you used to overcome them</span></p>

<p class=title3><span>Chart 1 required the most data cleaning and analysis. Each cryptocurrency had its own daily data for each calendar month e.g. BTCUSDT-1d-2019-07.csv. Therefore, the csv files of each month had to be merged to make the full data set for one cryptocurrency. This was achieved by running a script in terminal which can be found here. The closing price column of each data set was then copy and pasted into an excel spreadsheet for analysis. Daily returns for each cryptocurrency were then calculated using a loop in Stata to make the process less tedious - the code can be found here. I originally downloaded  15m data for this chart however the data set was too large to be uploaded to GitHub and it didn’t chart well for obvious reasons  thus I acquired lower frequency data. 
  Furthermore, to obtain the Dogecoin related tweets surrounding Chart 8, I scraped tweets from twitter. In my first attempt I imported the module ‘twitterscraper’ in google colab however I received an error as ‘twitterscraper’ is no longer working. So I had to use an alternative method using the module ‘insert’ – click here for the code.

<p class=title1><span class="bold">Conclusions of the project</span></p>

<p class=title3><span>From the visualisations presented, Elon Musk does hold great influence over the cryptocurrency market. We can see that, despite the $1trn market cap of Bitcoin, we saw a price increase of around 20% after the announcement of Tesla’s purchase showing his power to induce herding in the market. On the other hand, we saw Tesla’s share price fall leading the months after the announcement resulting in a negative correlation between the Bitcoin and Tesla share price. This could suggest conflicting view and opinions of Tesla and Bitcoin investors. However, the R2 value was 0.07 so this was a weak correlation which could have attributed to other factors. Furthermore, when looking at dogecoin, we observed a weak correlation when regressed on Bitcoin with an R2 of 0.01. This shows that dogecoin tends to move independent of the market which would make sense due its much smaller market cap compared with Bitcoin but also its lacking fundamentals perhaps creating a different kind of investor as opposed to those in the rest of the market. When analysing the chart and aligning it with viral dogecoin tweets from @elonmusk we can see sharp price movements showing his influence over the coin.
